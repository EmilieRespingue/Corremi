#### Corremi

##### How to use it
In the data folder there is a corremi.txt file. In it you can set title and lines of commentaries. Put in the ones you most commonly have to write. If you need to add a carriage return you put a <br>. If you are grading a paper you can put <> where the partial grades will go, and <total> where the final grade will be.
When you launch Corremi by double clicking on Corremi.jar each title will be a tab and each line will be a checkbox under it. Checking a box adds the text below. You can editing each line, which checks the box automatically. Putting a number in a <> displays it below and updates the <total> automatically.
